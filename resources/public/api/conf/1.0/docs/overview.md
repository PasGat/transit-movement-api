### What is this API for?
Submit details of transit movements that will be sent to the CTC data service and then be stored in mongo on MDTP. These transit movements have already been declared on the NCTS system and this API allows the capturing of data about them as they cross into the UK.

The expectation is that consuming applications of this API will use TLS version 1.2.
