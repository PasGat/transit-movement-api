### What is this API for?
This API is for sending data about transit movements. The transit movements will have already been declared in the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) when they are sent. Sending this data allows the office of transit process to be completed, which means the UK can be part of the Common Transit Convention.

The expectation is that consuming applications of this API will use TLS version 1.2.
